## Introduction
This is a collaborative project with other students at the University of Melbourne. My responsibility in the project is to write the analysis based on the visualization. Specifically, I needed to make sure the analysis flowed logically with the presentation of the report and provided the best course of action based on the arguments shown by the data. As an analyst, it is also very important to effectively communicate the findings of the data to the end users.

## Key Findings
Using data from the [Hollywood Stock Exchange](https://www.hsx.com/) database provided by the University of Melbourne, we evaluate the price of movie stock for Black Adam (ticker BADAM) by analyzing the historical price movements of similar movie stocks, seasonal trends, and the impact of Covid-19 on the movie industry. Ultimately, our prediction for Black Adam's first 24 days' earnings dictated that the stock would become much more valuable, and the decision was to BUY.
